# CAES-Simulation

This an emergency evacuation simulation system for Congestion Avoidance Evacuation System (CAES) and other algorithms.
In the simulation, CAES will be compared with five algorithms, including Load-balancing Emergency Guiding System (LEGS), Multiple Streaming Crowd Guidance (MSCG), Emergency Support System plus (ESS+), the algorithm that HEX Inc. uses, and Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.

The system is created for the research called "A Dynamic Crowd Guidance Service for Emergencies Based on Wireless Sensor Networks."
This paper is an undisclosed master's thesis.
If you have read this paper and want to test the algorithm, just download this project.

If you have further question, just create an issue to contact with me.
